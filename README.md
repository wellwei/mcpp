## Highlights

- **Native C++23 module support** — `import std` handled automatically, file-level incremental builds, automatic module dependency analysis, zero manual configuration
- **Pure modular self-hosting** — mcpp itself consists of 43+ C++23 modules and builds itself; the module pipeline is battle-tested
- **Works out of the box** — one-command install, bundled GCC 16 / LLVM 20 toolchains downloaded into an isolated sandbox, never polluting your system
- **Integrated dependency management** — SemVer constraint resolution, lockfile, cross-project BMI cache, custom package indices
- **Multi-package workspaces** — unified lockfile and version management for larger projects

## Why mcpp

mcpp is built specifically for **C++23 module-first development**. If you want to use `import std`, module interface units (`.cppm`), module partitions, and other modern C++ features in your project, mcpp gives you a smooth, friendly experience on Linux, macOS ARM64, and Windows x86_64:

- **Modular by default** — projects created by `mcpp new` use C++23 modules directly; `import std` just works
- **File-level incremental builds** — three-layer optimization based on P1689 dyndep (front-end dirty check + per-file scanning + BMI restat); only the modules that actually changed get recompiled
- **Create & build in one go** — `mcpp new hello && cd hello && mcpp build`; toolchains install automatically, no compiler or build-system setup required
- **A modular ecosystem** — [mcpplibs](https://github.com/mcpplibs) offers a growing set of directly `import`-able C++ module libraries, plus support for custom package indices

> [!NOTE]

## Getting Started

### Install

**Install via xlings** (recommended)

```bash
xlings install mcpp -y
```

<details>
<summary>Don't have xlings yet? Click for the install command</summary>

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://d2learn.org/xlings-install.sh | bash
```

**Windows — PowerShell**
```powershell
irm https://d2learn.org/xlings-install.ps1.txt | iex
```

> More about xlings → [xlings.d2learn.org](https://xlings.d2learn.org)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Optional — short commands (<code>mp</code>, <code>mbuild</code>, <code>mrun</code>, …)</summary>

```bash
xlings install mcpp-short-cmd -y
```

Registers 30 shims, so `mcpp build` becomes `mbuild`. Naming rule: initial of
every word but the last, plus the last word in full — `mcpp self doctor` →
`msdoctor`. `mp` is bare `mcpp`. They alias the `mcpp` shim rather than a fixed
binary, so `xlings use mcpp <ver>` switches them too.

| Short | Expands to | Short | Expands to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mp` | `mcpp` | `mexpkg` | `mcpp emit xpkg` |
| `mnew` | `mcpp new` | `mxparse` | `mcpp xpkg parse` |
| `mbuild` | `mcpp build` | `mtinstall` | `mcpp toolchain install` |
| `mrun` | `mcpp run` | `mtlist` | `mcpp toolchain list` |
| `mtest` | `mcpp test` | `mtdefault` | `mcpp toolchain default` |
| `mclean` | `mcpp clean` | `mcdir` | `mcpp cache dir` |
| `madd` | `mcpp add` | `mclist` | `mcpp cache list` |
| `mremove` | `mcpp remove` | `mcinfo` | `mcpp cache info` |
| `mupdate` | `mcpp update` | `mcgc` | `mcpp cache gc` |
| `msearch` | `mcpp search` | `milist` | `mcpp index list` |
| `mpublish` | `mcpp publish` | `miadd` | `mcpp index add` |
| `mpack` | `mcpp pack` | `miremove` | `mcpp index remove` |
| `msdoctor` | `mcpp self doctor` | `miupdate` | `mcpp index update` |
| `msenv` | `mcpp self env` | `msconfig` | `mcpp self config` |
| `msversion` | `mcpp self version` | `msexplain` | `mcpp self explain` |

</details>

**Other options**

<details>
<summary><b>Option 1</b> — one-line installer (Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS ARM64)</summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mcpp-community/mcpp/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

This installer does not support Windows; use the PowerShell xlings route above.
It installs into `~/.mcpp/` and adds it to your shell PATH. Deleting `~/.mcpp`
uninstalls cleanly.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 2</b> — Homebrew (macOS / Linux)</summary>

```bash
brew install mcpp-community/mcpp/mcpp-m
```

One command — it taps [`mcpp-community/homebrew-mcpp`](https://github.com/mcpp-community/homebrew-mcpp)
and installs the same prebuilt release binary. macOS needs Apple silicon +
macOS 14; per-user data lives in `~/.mcpp/`.

Homebrew's `mcpp` is an unrelated C preprocessor, hence the `mcpp-m` formula
name — the command it installs is still `mcpp`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 3</b> — Arch Linux (AUR)</summary>

```bash
yay -S mcpp-bin      # prebuilt release binary
yay -S mcpp-m        # or build from source (bootstrapped with mcpp-bin)
```

Installs the `mcpp` command system-wide; per-user data still lives in `~/.mcpp/`.
On Arch the name `mcpp` is an unrelated C preprocessor, so the packages are
`mcpp-bin` / `mcpp-m` (see [`scripts/aur/`](scripts/aur/)).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 4</b> — let an AI assistant install it for you</summary>

Copy the following prompt to your AI coding assistant (Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot, etc.):

```
Read the README of https://github.com/mcpp-community/mcpp,
then install mcpp for me and create a C++23 module project, build and run it.
The repo's .agents/skills/mcpp-usage/SKILL.md has a detailed usage guide.
```

</details>

### Create, build & run a project

```bash
mcpp new hello
cd hello
mcpp build
mcpp run
```

> Note: the first build initializes the environment and fetches the toolchain, which may take a while.

### Project layout

```
hello/
├── mcpp.toml             ← project manifest
├── src/
│   └── main.cpp          ← import std; works directly
└── tests/
    └── test_smoke.cpp    ← discovered by `mcpp test`
```

```toml
# mcpp.toml
[package]
name        = "hello"
version     = "0.1.0"
description = "A modular C++23 package"
license     = "Apache-2.0"
```

The built-in scaffold relies on convention: it does not write `[targets.hello]`.
`src/main.cpp` infers the binary target, and `mcpp test` automatically discovers
`tests/test_smoke.cpp`.

### Using module libraries

Add a two-line dependency to `mcpp.toml` to pull in a community module library from [mcpplibs](https://github.com/mcpplibs):

```toml
[dependencies]
cmdline = "0.0.2"
```

Then `import` it directly in your code:

```cpp
import mcpplibs.cmdline;
```

> For more dependency options (version constraints, namespaces, Git references, local paths, etc.), see the [mcpp.toml guide — dependency management](docs/05-mcpp-toml.md).

## Feature Overview

<details>
<summary><b>Build system</b></summary>

- Native C++20/23/26 module support (interface units, implementation units, module partitions), plus `c++latest` / `c++fly` experimental modes
- Fully automatic precompilation and caching of `import std` / `import std.compat`
- Three-layer incremental optimization: front-end dirty check + per-file P1689 dyndep + BMI copy-if-different restat
- Fingerprinted BMI cache: hashed by compiler/flags/standard library, shared across projects
- Ninja backend: auto-generated build.ninja, parallel compilation
- compile_commands.json generated automatically (ready for clangd / ccls)
- `mcpp ide configure` publishes a fresh CDB before ordinary TU compilation,
  so clangd can analyze a project whose source currently has build errors
- First-class C support: `.c` files auto-detected, mixed C/C++ projects
- User-defined cflags / cxxflags / ldflags / c_standard

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Toolchain management</b></summary>

- Bundled GCC 16.1.0 + LLVM/Clang 20.1.7, one-command install
- Host-aware defaults: native glibc GCC on Linux x86_64, musl GCC on other Linux architectures, LLVM on macOS and on Windows with usable MSVC, MinGW-w64 GCC on bare Windows
- Multiple versions side by side: `mcpp toolchain install gcc 16` / `mcpp toolchain install llvm 20`
- Isolated sandbox: all toolchains live in `~/.mcpp/registry/`, leaving the system untouched
- Per-platform selection: `linux = "gcc@16"`, `macos = "llvm@20"`
- GCC and Clang compile pipelines at parity (driven by the `BmiTraits` abstraction layer)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Package & dependency management</b></summary>

- SemVer constraint resolution: `^`, `~`, ranges, exact versions
- Three-stage resolution: constraint merging → multi-version mangling fallback → exact match
- Lockfile mcpp.lock (v2 format: index snapshot + namespaces)
- Namespace system: `[dependencies.myteam] foo = "1.0"`
- Custom package indices: `[indices] acme = "git@..."` / `{ path = "..." }`
- Project-level index isolation (`.mcpp/` directory, no global pollution)
- Dependency sources: index / Git / local path

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Workspaces</b></summary>

- `[workspace] members = ["libs/*", "apps/*"]`
- Unified lockfile + unified target directory
- Centralized version management: `[workspace.dependencies]` + `.workspace = true`
- Selective builds: `mcpp build -p member-name`
- Config inheritance: toolchains, build flags, and indices cascade from root to members

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Packaging & publishing</b></summary>

- `mcpp pack`: four Linux release modes — system / vendored (default) / self-contained / static; `bundle-project` and `bundle-all` remain compatibility aliases
- Fully static musl binaries: single-file distribution, no glibc dependency (matching Linux x86_64 or aarch64 target)
- `mcpp publish`: generates xpkg.lua + publishes to a package index
- Automatic RPATH fix-up via patchelf (Linux)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Developer experience</b></summary>

- `mcpp new` — create a modular project; `--template <pkg>[@ver][:<tmpl>]` uses a **library-provided template** (e.g. `--template imgui`); `--list-templates <pkg>` lists them
- `mcpp run [-- args]` — build and run
- `mcpp test [pattern] [-- args]` — auto-discover and run tests (filter by name; `--list`, `--timeout <s>`, `--message-format json`)
- `mcpp search` — search package indices
- `mcpp add / remove / update` — dependency management
- `mcpp why [toolchain|runtime|deps]` — explain resolved build decisions
- `mcpp --offline` / `MCPP_OFFLINE=1` — use only already available local state
- `mcpp explain E0001` — detailed error-code explanations
- `mcpp self doctor` — environment self-diagnosis

</details>

## Platform Support

mcpp's identity model has two orthogonal axes: a **toolchain** is
`family@version` (family ∈ gcc | llvm | msvc), a **target** is a triple
`arch-os[-env]`. Cross-compiling is just `mcpp build --target <triple>` —
the right toolchain payload is resolved and installed automatically.
`mcpp toolchain list` shows live status on your machine.

**Hosts** (where mcpp itself runs): Linux x86_64 / aarch64, macOS arm64, Windows x86_64.

**Targets** (what `--target` accepts; this table mirrors the in-code vocabulary):

| Target | Convention toolchain | Status |
|---|---|:---:|
| `x86_64-linux-gnu`    | gcc *(Linux default)* or llvm | ✅ |
| `x86_64-linux-musl`   | gcc 16, fully static | ✅ |
| `aarch64-linux-musl`  | gcc 16, fully static — cross from x86_64 (qemu-verified) or native | ✅ |
| `x86_64-windows-gnu`  | gcc 16 MinGW-w64 — native on Windows, cross from Linux (wine-verified) *(Windows default without Visual Studio)* | ✅ |
| `x86_64-windows-msvc` | `msvc@system` (detected VS/BuildTools) or llvm ¹ *(Windows default with Visual Studio)* | ✅ |
| `aarch64-macos`       | llvm *(macOS default)* | ✅ |
| `riscv64-linux-musl`  | — | 🔄 |
| `aarch64-linux-gnu`   | — | 🔄 |
| `x86_64-macos`        | — | 🔄 |

✅ verified — CI builds **and executes** the artifact end-to-end (qemu/wine included) ｜ 🔄 planned

> Linux release binaries are fully static musl builds for x86_64 and aarch64
> (`x86_64-linux-musl` and `aarch64-linux-musl`).
> Legacy spellings — `x86_64-w64-mingw32`, `gcc@16.1.0-musl`, `mingw-cross@…`,
> `musl-gcc@…` — stay permanently accepted as aliases and normalize to the
> canonical forms above.
>
> ¹ On Windows, llvm targets the MSVC ABI and therefore requires an existing
> **MSVC BuildTools or Visual Studio** (UCRT, Windows SDK, MSVC STL). You do
> not have to arrange this: on first run mcpp checks for a usable MSVC and,
> finding none, defaults to `x86_64-windows-gnu` (winlibs MinGW-w64) — fully
> self-contained, no Visual Studio, `import std` included. Nothing to install
> or configure; `mcpp new && mcpp build` just works on a stock Windows box.
> An explicit `[toolchain]` in `mcpp.toml` is always respected as written —
> mcpp revises its own default, never yours.

## Contributing

Contributions via issues and PRs are welcome. The project accepts contributions developed with AI agents.

**Basic workflow**

1. Open an issue — for bug fixes, new features, or improvements, start a discussion in [issues](https://github.com/mcpp-community/mcpp/issues) first
2. Implement the change — fork the repo, create a branch, and verify according to scope (`mcpp build` plus relevant tests for behavior changes; examples and links for documentation-only changes)
3. Submit a PR — use `gh pr create` and make sure CI passes
4. CI must pass — PRs with failing CI will not be merged

**Commit message convention**: `feat:` / `fix:` / `test:` / `docs:` / `refactor:` prefixes

**AI agent contributions**: the repo's [`.agents/skills/mcpp-contributing/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/mcpp-contributing/SKILL.md) provides a complete agent contribution workflow and project structure guide. Just send this prompt to your AI assistant:

```
Read .agents/skills/mcpp-contributing/SKILL.md of the
https://github.com/mcpp-community/mcpp repository,
then follow the guide to help me submit a contribution to mcpp.
```
